# TMS320A
An archive of an ancient TMS320 assembler from the 1990s

## Abstract
This is the original source code for a TMS320 assember for MS-DOS that was written
by Lloyd Miller in 1994. I used it to create an assembler for the Macintosh by
wrapping it in a simple GUI for use with the TI DSK.

Lloyd's original documentation is here: [dska.doc](dska.doc)

NOTE: This source code was formatted with newlines that could confuse some text
editors. I have reformatted it for standard Linux style newlines.
